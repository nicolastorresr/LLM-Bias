# LLM-Bias
This project contains the implementation and results of bias detection experiments in large language models.

#### Requirements and Environment Setup
The experiments were conducted using Python 3.9+. To maintain a clean environment and avoid conflicts with other projects, it is recommended to use a virtual environment.

1. Create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv llm_bias_env
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS/Linux:

```
source llm_bias_env/bin/activate
```


- On Windows:

```
.\llm_bias_env\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install Required Packages
To install the required dependencies, run the following command from the root directory of the replication package:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
